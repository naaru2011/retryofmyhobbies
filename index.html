        <h1>Hobby: playing</h1>
        <h4> I like playing because I love to be a gamer when I grow up and become a teenager. I have also been trying to be great at playing and become a master at Video Games! It takes a lot of time to be a cool gamer. First, you have to first try the game you want to play and then play it. You can'
        t just smack-dab just not like it then play it over and over again. For example: Once I played this game my friend asked me to play, and then I got scared of it. But then once I was able to survive the horor in it, I continued playing it. See, what you have to do is try leave out the scary parts or the parts which you don't like. For example: the jumpscares in the game I was scared of. When you get killed they give out a really, really scary jumpscare, so what I basicly do is mute the audio from the jumpscares. So, if the music sounds scary or bad, then mute the audio of the device you are playing! If the GAME is bad or scary, then don't play it. Just play another game which you would prefer. Play something which you enjoy, have fun in, or which makes you laugh! üòÉüòÅüòÑ </h4>

When I wanna become a gamer, I first wanna become a youtuber so that everyone can see my gaming. It would be fun to go play with friends on youtube. But first PICK a game. Don't let your friends pick the game. It's your choice.</h4>
